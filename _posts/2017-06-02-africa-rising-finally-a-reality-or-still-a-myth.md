title: Africa Rising: Finally A Reality Or Still A Myth?
---
Not so long ago Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, the social media giant, took his [first trip](http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/30/technology/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-africa-nigeria-lagos/) to Sub-Saharan Africa, making surprise visits to Nigeria and Kenya. His maiden African tour has been attributed to the rising economic fortunes of the continent and perceived technological revolution. For the last couple of years, Africa has been seen as an economic ‘rising star’ and this has led to the World’s sudden attention towards the continent.

Africa’s ‘rising’ status has also been reinforced by the increasing presence of multi-national companies which have opened up shop within the continent. One good example is the American tech behemoth, IBM, which [opened](http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/corporate/IBM-opens-its-first-Africa-research-lab-in-Nairobi-on-Friday/539550-2058736-h099hw/index.html) its multi-million dollar research center in Nairobi, the first of its kind in Sub-Saharan Africa. Other technology giants like Google, Microsoft, Intel and General Electric (GE) have significantly increased their footprints in the continent as well.

Africa’s narrative hasn’t always been a rosy one. Africa has long been regarded as the ‘Dark’ continent, a jungle where hunger, disease and war are rampant; and corruption is the order of the day. As a matter of fact, in May 2000, The Economist published an [article](http://www.economist.com/node/333429) titled: **Hopeless Africa**, in which the continent was portrayed as totally hopeless, with virtually no prospects of a better future for its inhabitants.

Despite all the negative stereotypical view that the outside world has held about Africa for a long time, the continent has made tremendous progress on many fronts. So much so that the Economist changed its stand when it published yet another [article](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21572377-african-lives-have-already-greatly-improved-over-past-decade-says-oliver-august) in March 2013 (a little over a decade after its May 2000 article) entitled “**A Hopeful Continent**” in which it portrayed Africa as having made tremendous progress and was poised to ‘follow in the footsteps of Asia’.

And as if to drive the point home, the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit was held for the very first time in Sub-Saharan Africa, an event that was graced by President Barack Obama.

At the turn of the new millennium, the World Bank released a [report](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22962) entitled: **Can Africa Claim the 21st Century**? This report, published in the year 2000, gave a thorough analysis and insights on the areas that Africa needed to focus on if it was ever going to claim the new century. Some of the main areas that would require priority according to the report were: Improving Governance, Managing Conflict and Rebuilding States; Addressing Poverty and Inequality; Investing in People and Lowering Infrastructure, Information and Finance Barriers. The report also highlighted some of the reasons why certain countries like South Korea and Singapore (the so called 'Asian Tigers') were able to achieve meteoric rise in their economies, despite the fact that they were at par with most African countries back in the 1960's. One alarming finding made by the report was that Africa totally missed the Industrial Revolution, and was at risk of being left out of the Information/Digital Revolution as well.

So, is Africa’s rise finally a reality? Well, perhaps, but a lot still needs to be done in order to sustain the momentum that the continent has gained so far. Many people believe that Africa is at a pivotal moment in its history, much like China was three decades ago. The positive sentiment towards Africa was clearly articulated by President Obama in his July 28, 2015 [speech](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/28/remarks-president-obama-people-africa) given at the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Here is an excerpt from the speech: “**Africa’s middle class is projected to grow to more than one billion consumers. With hundreds of millions of mobile phones and surging access to the Internet, Africans have the potential to leapfrog old technologies into new prosperity. So Africa is on the move, and a new Africa is emerging**.” A new Africa is emerging indeed.

Some of the challenges that Africa has to confront urgently are effects of globalization, rapid advancements in science and technology, and the coming of age of the knowledge-based economy. In order to stay relevant in the 21st century, the continent needs to make massive investments in areas such as innovation, higher education and training, research and development, entrepreneurship, ICT and telecommunications, infrastructure and energy. While some African countries have already made substantive strides towards achieving these goals, some are still lagging behind.

Kenya, for example, is leading the pack in the technology innovation sector, with its game-changing mobile money transfer platform, MPESA. [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com/), yet another Kenyan invention has been hailed as a ground-breaking real-time reporting tool and has consequently been widely adapted in other countries outside the continent. Kenya forms part of what I like calling the **African Golden triangle of technology**; Nigeria and South Africa being the other two countries that complete the triangle. These three nations have led the rest of the continent in coming up with innovative technology products and companies. One such company is Nigeria’s [Jumia](https://www.jumia.com.ng/) (often referred to as Africa’s Amazon.com). These countries are also home to some of the most entrepreneurial tech hubs in the continent. In Nairobi, Kenya there is the [iHub](https://ihub.co.ke/), a co-working space that has spawned many start-up companies, one of which is [MobiDev](http://mobidev.co.ke/), a mobile and web applications development company. Nigeria has [ccHub](http://cchubnigeria.com/) that is located in the Yaba area of Lagos, while South Africa has [JoziHub](http://jozihub.org/), found in the city of Johannesburg.

As the authors Jake Bright and Aubrey Hruby point out in chapter six of their [book](https://www.amazon.com/Next-Africa-Emerging-Continent-Powerhouse/dp/125006371X) ‘THE NEXT AFRICA’, published in 2015, the rise of the so called ‘Silicon Savannah’ is poised to make Africa a global player in the tech industry.

Between 2001 and 2010, some of the fastest-growing economies in the world were African. Countries like Chad, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda and Angola grew at rates of between 7.6%~11% which was way above the world average. In fact, according to the [Economist Daily Chart](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart) of January, 6th 2011, in the period 2001-2010, Angola’s economy grew at the rate of 11.1%, which was the highest in the world (China grew at 10.5% during this period). The average growth rate for the whole Sub-Saharan region comprising of 48 countries was 5.4%, far above the 3.6% global average.

Despite its recent achievements, Africa is still grappling with some fundamental problems that will hinter its continued progress. One such hindrance is the fact that some 48% of Africans are still living on $1.25 or less a day. This is definitely bad news as it does not offer a viable market for innovative ventures.

As the 2016-2017 Global Competitiveness [Report](https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2016-2017-1) released by the World Economic Forum clearly points out, innovation is going to play a key role in determining the survival of any country in the 21st century knowledge-based economy. Looking at the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) released alongside the report, the only African countries that fared well were Mauritius (at number 45 globally), South Africa (47) and Rwanda (52).

Another important index that was released last year by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) was the [Global Innovation Index](http://www.wipo.int/econ_stat/en/economics/gii/) (GII). Again, Mauritius came in as the first African country on the list at number 53, followed by South Africa (54) and then Kenya at number 80 globally but third in Africa.

In both these indices, African countries performed poorly in areas such as Business and Market Sophistication, Knowledge and Technology Outputs, Higher Education and Training, Technological Readiness and Institutions.

As the rest of the World is ushering in the [4th Industrial Revolution](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/) (a phenomenon characterized by the convergence of the physical, digital and biological systems), Africa needs to put in place mechanisms that will ensure its place is guaranteed in the new global architecture of nations.
