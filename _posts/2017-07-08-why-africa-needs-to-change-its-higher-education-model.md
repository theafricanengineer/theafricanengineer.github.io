title: Why Africa Needs To Change Its Higher Education Model
---
It is often said that a country's economic might greatly depends on the strength of its institutions of higher learning. This assertion has held true across all the past centuries and it is even truer in this century. The ancient **Greeks** and the **Romans** had their **Academies**. The **British Empire** had its revered Universities of **Oxford** and **Cambridge** (Oxbridge), which are still beacons of higher education up to this day.

Perhaps the best example of the correlation between a country's economic might and its higher education is the United States of America. The USA rose to become the most powerful nation on earth, partly because of its unrivalled institutions of higher learning. **Harvard**, **Yale**, **Stanford**, **MIT**, **CMU**, **Princeton** (among many other excellent American universities),  have become an envy of the world. These institutions have led in carrying out cutting-edge **research and development** activities that have sometimes proved to be crucial to their nation's survival. For instance, during the second world war, the **US Department of Defense** did a lot of military research in collaboration with academic institutions like Harvard and MIT.

In more recent history, countries like Israel, India, Singapore and South Korea have blazed the trail of higher education. Through institutions like the **Technion - Israel Institute of Technology**, **National University of Singapore**, **Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology** (KAIST) and the **Indian Institutes of Technology**, these nations have positioned themselves at the forefront of technologocal research and innovation.

#### New Challenges for Institutions of Higher Learning

At the very core, an institution of higher learning has traditionally served two major purposes:

* Teaching - Passing of knowledge
* Research - Creation of new knowledge

With the rapid rise of online courses through **MOOC** services like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), the first purpose for the existence of the traditional university (**teaching**) is under serious threat. Students don't have to attend formal classes to gain knowledge anymore. Virtually **ALL** courses that are offered in universities can now be easily accessed online by a click of a button.

Some years back **John Hennessy**, the former Stanford University's president and the 2012 **IEEE Medal of Honor** Recipient, [predicted](http://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/profiles/john-l-hennessy-risk-taker) the death of the lecture hall as more of college education moves online. Why would a student sit through a boring 2-hour lecture given by a professor who sometimes lacks the mastery of the subject matter? Should she attend that CS 101 class taught by lecturer X in lecture hall 205 in a real campus setting OR log on to [CS50.tv](http://cs50.tv/2016/fall/) and watch the marvelous lecture by **Dr. David Malan**, the famed Harvard Professor? The challenge for colleges now is to convince such a student that choosing the former rather than the latter would be worth their time (and money).

This basically means that universities may have to start relying more on research and development (rather than teaching) in order to remain relevant.

The other serious challenge for universities is the constant shift in the skills that would be required by the jobs of the future. And to make matters even worse, how can colleges prepare students for jobs that don't even exist yet? 

According to an [article](https://www.themuse.com/advice/10-job-skills-youll-need-in-2020) on **The Muse**, the following will be the most important work skills by 2020:

* Sense Making
* Social Intelligence
* Novel and Adaptive Thinking
* Cross-cultural Competency
* Computational Thinking
* New Media Literacy
* Transdisciplinary
* Design Mindset
* Cognitive Load Management
* Virtual Collaboration

And according to the World Economic Forum, the top 10 [skills](http://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs) that one would need to thrive in 2020 are:

* Complex Problem Solving
* Critical Thinking
* Creativity
* People Management
* Coordinating with Others
* Emotional Intelligence
* Judgement and Decision Making
* Service Orientation
* Negotiation
* Cognitive Flexibility

So, how can colleges impart these skills to students now, in preparation for 2020 and beyond? And can these skills be taught in the first place? 

Going by the two lists above, it's very clear that institutions of higher learning will have to rethink their teaching strategies in order to align themselves with the job market requirements. It's no longer business as usual.

#### The African Scenario

Since Times Higher Education (THE) - a UK-based firm focused on higher education started releasing its rankings of African research universities in 2015, the top positions have constantly been [dominated](https://qz.com/449143/more-than-half-of-africas-top-research-universities-are-in-south-africa/) by South African institutions. Out of the top five in the 2015's pilot [ranking](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/south-african-institutions-top-rankings-pilot), four were from South Africa, with the University of Cape Town ([UCT](https://www.uct.ac.za)) leading the pack.

In most of the other University campuses across the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), things are still done the 'old' way. Students are expected to attend very **uninspiring lectures**, do assignments and CATs, and then sit for the **end-of-semester exams** (which are usually **recycled** because the professors have NO TIME to set fresh questions). This rigid routine is repeated every other semester for the next four years of the students' life in campus. The lecturers use very **outdated curricula** that they can't even remember when they were last revised. 

Instead of developing **critical thinking skills**, students have mastered the art of **rote learning** and **cramming** for exams. They have become incredibly **obssessed with grades**, at the expense of genuine acquisition of **knowledge** and skills. This has inevitably led to a situation where after spending four years in college, a university graduate is not able to thrive in the real job market. Most often, companies are forced to **retrain** such graduates in order for them to undertake any real projects.

So, what needs to be done in order to remedy an already very dire situation?

#### A New Paradigm for Higher Education in Africa

I sure as hell know that there are no easy solutions to these problems. That quick fixes might just be as bad as no solution at all. But we must start somewhere. Because if we don't, we will be sitting on a **ticking time bomb** that would be much worse when it explodes.

I believe that any student graduating from a university in this day and age, should, at the very least, possess the following five skills:

>* Collaboration/teamwork/communication skills
* Adaptation to change/flexibilty skills
* Critical thinking/problem solving skills
* Creativity/innovation skills
* Life-long learning skills

In order to foster these skills, colleges across Africa will have to adopt a new model of higher education.

There should be a shift away from rote learning and the **traditional lecture method** where a professor stands in front of a class and 'delivers' knowledge to a **passive audience** of students who silently wish they would rather be somewhere else. Colleges should embrace **project-based learning** where students are actively engaged through **stimulating** project activities that are accomplished through **collaboration** and **teamwork**. During project team meetings, students should be encouraged to participate in **constructive criticisms** and **arguments**, in order to improve their communication skills. Classes should be **small** enough to allow for closer interactions between professors ans students. 

University lecturers should be allowed to **experiment** with different **methods** and **styles** of **knowledge delivery**, and not be forced to '**stick to the syllabus guidelines**'. It should never be mandated that the ONLY way to assess a student's ability is through assignments, CATs and an exam at the end of the semester. If a professor thinks that his students will be better assessed through projects and other **non-conventional methods**, he should have it his way. After all, the professor is the one who knows what he wants to achieve by the end of the course, right? Here is a great quote from [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), the reknowned American physicist and one of the most famous professors of all time (emphasis is mine):

>"First, figure out **WHY** you want the students to learn the subject and **WHAT** you want them to **KNOW**, and the **METHOD** will result more or less by **COMMON SENSE**."

From that quote, the METHOD of delivery of knowledge should never be dictated by some external force, other than the instructor himself. And the professors who succeed in devising the best teaching methods should always be rewarded for their great work.

The **rigid academic structure** should also be broken down in favour of a more **flexible** one. The easiest way to make an African graduate look perplexed is to ask him, "***what was your college major?***" Did you say a college major? That phrase is alien to most of us. We think it only exists in American and European universities. When you are admitted into an African university, you are allowed to do a certain course. And that's it. No **majors** and **minors**. And what about a **double major**? Forget it. That is most definitely out of the question. So, when you are admitted to do **Electrical Engineering**, you will graduate with a degree in Electrical Engineering, period. Nothing more, nothing less.

The rationale behind this is that when a kid from high school joins college, he has already made up his mind about which career he is going follow for the rest of his life. But most of the time, this is never entirely true. This invariably leads to situations where students end up in professions they thought they initially liked, but no longer do.

On the other hand, in most Western colleges, students are allowed to pick their majors when they are well into their second years of study. It is common to hear of someone with a major in **Computer Science** and a minor in **Philosophy**, or a double major in **Law** and **Economics**.

In this modern world, most professions require multi-disciplinary knowledge and therefore students should be given the freedom to '**mix and match**' different courses that suit them most. A student majoring in Mechanical Engineering  for example, should be allowed to minor in something like Psychology or International Relations if they so wish, and should not be barred from doing so by '**college academic regulations**'.

After all is said and done, what matters most is that the students should come out of college well equipped to tackle the **complex** problems that exist in the real world. That they should become **life-long learners**, and be flexible enough to **adapt** easily to rapid changes in their respective work places. The following quote from Stanford engineering professor and former dean **James Plummer**'s talk given at the [IEEE Vision, Innovation and Challenges Summit](http://ieee-vics.org/) held in San Fransisco in May, this year, aptly sums it up:

>"I used to tell students it doesn't matter what we teach you because it will be obsolete when you graduate, so go out and have a good time." 

The only things that can never become obsolete when they gradute are their skills in problem solving, critical thinking, communication, teamwork and life-long learning. 

#### Research Output and Academia-Industry Collaboration will Matter More

As already mentioned, **research** is the only area that the traditional university will still have an upper hand, now that '**lecture-hall**' teaching might be dying a slow death.

African institutions of higher learning will have to encourage their faculty and graduate students to carry out more research and **publish** their findings in **peer-reviewed** journals. Academic institutions should develop closer **collaborations** with industries in order to make sure that what they are teaching is relevant and **in-sync** with the requirements of the industry.

Academic faculty should regularly be given **leaves of absence** to go and work in industries for certain periods of time in order to stay 'in touch' with the real industry. This will in turn help them in carrying out research with the aim of solving real industrial problems, and not just theoritical stuff.

#### Some Institutions Showing Great Promise

Since the beginning of the new century, a number of institutions of higher learning have sprung up in different parts of Africa and have shown great promise so far. Here are just a few of them.

**[Ashesi](https://www.ashesi.edu.gh) University**

Established in 2002 by [Patrick Awuah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Awuah,_Jr.), Ashesi University is a private liberal arts college in Accra, Ghana. One of its stated goals is to bring the American liberal arts college experience to Africa. Since its founding, the university has attracted a lot of attention from within the continent and across the world as well. You can watch the TED talk given by the University's founder, Dr. Awuah, in Arusha, Tanzania [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/patrick_awuah_on_educating_leaders).

**African Institute for Mathematical Sciences ([AIMS](https://www.aims.ac.za))**

This is a research institute that was established in 2003 by the South African physicist [Neil Turok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Turok). From its founding in South Africa, the institute has since expanded to Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria. AIMS's flagship offering is a Structured graduate programme in the Mathmatical Sciences. The institute is also running an initiative dubbed [The Next Einstein](https://www.nexteinstein.org), aimed at discovering the next great scientist from Africa. You can watch Professor Turok's TED talk about the initiative [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/neil_turok_makes_his_ted_prize_wish).

**African University of Science and Technology ([AUST](https://www.aust.edu.ng))**

This is a private research university that was established in 2007 in Abuja, Nigeria by the **Nelson Mandela Institution** (NMI) aimed at bringing the highest level of technical learning facilities to Africa. 

**Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology ([NM-AIST](https://nm-aist.ac.tz))**

This is another public university affiliated with the Nelson Mandela Institution (NMI) that was established in Arusha, Tanzania in 2010. It is a research intensive institution that specializes in postgraduate and post-doctoral studies in Science, Engineering and Technology (SET).

**Carnegie Mellon University-Africa**

[CMU-Africa](https://www.cmu.edu/africa/) is a branch of the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. It began in 2012 through a collaboration between the Rwandan government and CMU. It is situated in Kigali, Rwanda and offers two masters programmes in Information Technology (MSIT) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (MSECE).
