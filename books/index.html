	<h3>TECHNICAL BOOKS</h3><hr>
	<h4>Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. Publisher: Addison-Wesley.</h4>
	<p><img class="img-container" alt="Algorithms" src="../img/Book1.jpg"></p>
	<p>This is an excellent introductory book on Algorithms(and Data Structures). Even though the book is based on Java, many of the fundamental concepts cut across all major programming languages. In fact, many of the algorithms in the book have been implemented in other languages like Python, C++, etc.
		The one thing that I like the most about the book is how the authors apply the <b>Scientific Method</b> in analysing the performance of the Algorithms. It's also a very practical book (Compared to CLRS), with lots of Java code that you can write and analyse on your own.
		Here are some of the great concepts that the book covers:
		<ul>
		<li>The fundamental CS concept of (Data) Abstraction</li>
		<li>Fundamental Data Structures e.g. Stacks, Queues and Bags</li>
		<li>The Analysis of Algorithms (Using the Scientific Method)</li>
		<li>Classic Sorting Algorithms, e.g. Mergesort and Quicksort</li>
		<li>Searching Algorithms e.g Binary Search Trees, Balanced Search Trees, Hash Tables, etc</li>
		<li>Graph Data Structures e.g Directed and Undirected Graphs, Minimum Spanning Trees</li>
		<li>Strings: String Sorts and Tries, etc</li>
		<li>And a lot more...</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>The authors have also created a two-part course on Coursera based on the book:
		<ul>
			<li>Algorithms, Part I. Link <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1" target="_blank">here.</a></li>
			<li>Algorithms, Part II. Link <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2" target="_blank">here.</a></li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h4>The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena. Publisher: Springer.</h4>
	<p><img class="img-container" alt="Algorithm-Design-Manual" src="../img/Book6.jpg"></p>
	<p>This is an intermediate-to-advanced-level book on Algorithms. If you are totally new to Algorithms, this might not be the best book for you. As the title indicates, the book is
		heavily skewed towards the design of algorithms (rather than just the analysis of common algorithms). The code snippets are written in C. The thing that I like the most about the book is the concept of <b>"War Stories"</b> - Interesting tales of real-world technical problems that require the application of algorithms.

		Here are some of the great concepts that the book covers:
		<ul>
		<li>Dynamic Programming</li>
		<li>Graph Traversal Techniques</li>
		<li>Combinatorial Search and Heuristic Methods</li>
		<li>Examples of Intractable Problems - E.g. P vs. NP, and NP-complete Problems.</li>
		<li>And a lot more...</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h4>Code Complete by Steve McConnell. Publisher: Microsoft Press.</h4>
	<p><img class="img-container" alt="Code-Complete" src="../img/Book3.jpg"></p>
	<p>Written by a former Microsoft software engineer, this book is a real gem for any self-respecting software engineer. It covers the art of Software Construction (or what we generally refer to as "Programming") in a very detailed(and refreshing) way.
		From simple things as variable names to how to write self-documenting code, this book elegantly captures the knowledge about best (and effective) software development practices. What I like most about the book is the fact that it uses a variety of
		different programming languages to illustrate some of the best practices (C/C++, Java, Visual Basic, etc). This is one of the reasons why I think it is better than Clean Code. (My personal opinion!)
		Here are some of the great concepts that the book covers:
		<ul>
		<li>Defensive Programming</li>
		<li>Code Debugging and Refactoring Techniques</li>
		<li>Code-Tuning Strategies and Techniques</li>
		<li>Programming Tools: Design tools, Source-Code tools, etc</li>
		<li>Code Layout Styles and Techniques</li>
		<li>And a lot more...</li>
		</ul>

	<h4>Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Freeman. Publisher: O'Reilly.</h4>
	<p><img class="img-container" alt="Design-Patterns" src="../img/Book7.jpg"></p>
	<p>This is a more "accessible/approachable" version of the classic Gang-of-Four book. Knowledge of Design Patterns is indispensable, especially for Mid-Senior level software engineers, and this book does a great job of explaining some of the most
		common design patterns out there, using very entertaining illustrations/diagrams! This alone, makes the book very fun to read. Even though the code examples are in Java, the knowledge is easily transferable to other OOP languages (e.g C#).
		With this book, you get to learn and really understand some of the most "famous" Design Patterns, e.g. Singleton Pattern, Factory Pattern, Decorator Pattern, etc.

	<h4>Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. Publisher: No Starch Press.</h4>
	<p><img class="img-container" alt="Python-Crash-Course" src="../img/Book18.jpg"></p>
	<p>This is, by far, the best introductory book on Python programming that I have ever come across. Written by a High School science and math teacher, the book takes a beginner approach to learning how to program. The book is divided into
		two parts: the first part introduces the learner to the foundational concepts of programming in Python, and the second part reinforces the concepts learnt in the first part by building three real-world projects (A game, a data visualization project and a web application).
		If you are a total beginner to programming, this is definitely the book for you.
	<p>The Amazon link for the book can be found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

	<h4>Learning Python by Mark Lutz. Publisher: O'Reilly.</h4>
	<p><img class="img-container" alt="Python-Crash-Course" src="../img/Book16.jpg"></p>
	<p>At over 1500 pages, this is the most comprehensive book on Python that you can find around. Mark Lutz is considered an authority on Python, having started writing about the language in the early 1990s.
